# Phonebook Backend

Full Stack Open

## Usage

**GET /info** Displays the number of entries in the phonebook and the current date.

**GET /api/persons** Displays all entries in the phonebook in the JSON format.

**GET /api/persons/:id** Displays a single entry in the phonebook corresponding to `id` if it can be found, or sends a 404 status code.

**DELETE /api/persons/:id** Deletes the entry in the phonebook corresponding to `id` if it can be found.

**POST /api/persons** Adds an entry to the phonebook in the JSON format with a randomized unique `id` property. For the backend to accept an entry, the entry must have at least the `name` and `number` properties, or a 400 status code will be sent. Extraneous properties will be removed by the backend before the entry is added to the phonebook.

## Environment variables

**MONGODB_URI** MongoDB connection string

**PORT** Port used by the backend

## JSON entry format

**Important:** The `id` property is automatically generated by the backend. Do not manually generate an `id`.

**Important:** Extraneous properties will be removed by the backend before the entry is added to the phonebook.

```json
{
	"id": "...",
	"name": "Foo Bar",
	"number": "123-456-7890"
}
```
